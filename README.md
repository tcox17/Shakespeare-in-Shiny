# Shakespeare in Shiny

This project is an app created with R shiny which investigates words in 3 different Shakespeare plays including 'A Mid Summer Night's Dream', 'The Merchant of Venice', and 'Romeo and Juliet'. This will visualize a word cloud of most common words used in each play and a word count chart for highest recurring words. The application was deployed here: https://tcox24.shinyapps.io/Cox-Problem-Set-3/
